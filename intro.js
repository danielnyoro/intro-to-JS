/** 
 * Rules for Creating variables
 * 1. should use the camelcase naming convention 
 * 2. JS is case sensitive
 * 3. Don"t Start variables with numbers, always start start with lowercase letter.
 * 4. Do not use reserved keywords( words used by the programming language)
 * 5. As a rule of the thumb always use const or let to create variables.
